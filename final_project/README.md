This project aims to build a classifier for traffic incidents in terms of Severity, 1 being the least severe and 4 being the most.

The data is too large to add to GitHub directly and is thus available here: ![Sample Data](https://kaggle.com/datasets/9171f9a66758cb92b2e52c0fbfb94716f985af48de4639890b1352c1afb9d4c0)

The project report is available here: ![Report](https://github.com/pmthr/comp562/blob/main/final_project/report.pdf)

The models built for this project are:
