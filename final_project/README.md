## Pooja Mathur, Sanaa Dalvi, Ananya Gode, Siya Yeolekar

This project aims to build a classifier for traffic incidents in terms of Severity, 1 being the least severe and 4 being the most.

The data is too large to add to GitHub directly and is thus available here: [Sample Data](https://kaggle.com/datasets/9171f9a66758cb92b2e52c0fbfb94716f985af48de4639890b1352c1afb9d4c0)

The project report is available here: [Report](https://github.com/pmthr/comp562/blob/main/final_project/report.pdf)

The models built for this project are:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Classifier
